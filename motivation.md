After my last career ended, I took a year off to re-asses.
Once that year came to an end (as sad as it was), I needed to find some work.
I looked...and looked...and looked, but nothing I wanted to do; nothing challenging.
After talking to a couple friends that went through the BE program, I decided to
do a "Try Coding" weekend to see if this was a fit.
After that weekend, I realized that this was something I wanted to do; something
challenging.
Proceeding with this career path can open so many doors, and also open a lot of
dormant space up in my brain.
I'm a huge fan of puzzles, and (to me) learning all this just makes me think I'm
learning how to put together a more challenging puzzle...which I'm a huge fan of!
